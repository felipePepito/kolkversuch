reinterpret_cast < new_type > ( expression ) 		

Converts between types by reinterpreting the underlying bit pattern.
Returns a value of type new_type.

Unlike static_cast, but like const_cast, the reinterpret_cast expression 
does not compile to any CPU instructions. It is purely a compiler directive which instructs 
the compiler to treat the sequence of bits (object representation) of expression 
as if it had the type new_type.

SAL

The Microsoft source-code annotation language (SAL) 
provides a set of annotations that you can use to 
describe how a function uses its parameters, 
the assumptions that it makes about them, and the guarantees that it makes when it finishes. 

The annotations are defined in the header file <sal.h>

Example: 
_In_ 
Data is passed to the called function, and is treated as read-only.

LRESULT (typedef long LONG_PTR)
CALLBACK (#define CALLBACK __stdcall) calling convention for calling the function

_____
LONG_PTR WINAPI SetWindowLongPtr(
  _In_  HWND hWnd,
  _In_  int nIndex,
  _In_  LONG_PTR dwNewLong
);

Changes an attribute of the specified window. 
The function also sets a value at the specified offset in the extra window memory.

HANDLE WINAPI CreateEvent(
  _In_opt_  LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpEventAttributes,
  _In_      BOOL bManualReset,
  _In_      BOOL bInitialState,
  _In_opt_  LPCTSTR lpName
);

Creates or opens a named or unnamed event object.
